            <p>Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The
                objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and mounted at a height of
                10 feet (3.048 m) to backboards at each end of the court.</p>

            <p>Hockey is a family of sports in which two teams play against each other by trying to maneuver a ball
                or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. In many areas, one sport (typically field
                hockey or ice hockey[1]) is generally referred to simply as hockey.</p>

            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may
                be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per
                side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
                activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are
                scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half
                of the court.</p>

            <p>Carrom (also known as Karrom) is a "strike and pocket" table game of Eastern origin similar to
                billiards and table shuffleboard. It is found throughout the East under different names though most
                non-eastern people know it by the East Asian name of Carroms (or Karrom). It is very popular in
                Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and surrounding areas and in the Middle East as well.
                In South Asia, many clubs and caf√©s hold regular tournaments. Carrom is very commonly played by
                families, including the children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist in
                different areas.</p>
