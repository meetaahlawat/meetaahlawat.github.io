                                            <p>Durga-puja is part of the Navaratri festival (nine nights) and is one of the greatest Hindu festivals. It symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. It takes place at the beginning of October around harvest time and, as the name implies, this festival is celebrated for nine days. During this period Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati are worshipped as three different manifestations of Shakti, or cosmic energy. The festival is dedicated to Durga, the mother goddess who also represents power. Durga annihilated the demon Mahishasura after a relentless battle lasting nine days and nights. Durga Puja festival marks the victory of Goddess Durga over the evil buffalo demon Mahishasura .<br><br>
                                                Thus, Durga Puja festival epitomizes the victory of Good over Evil. In Bengal, Durga is worshipped as Durgotinashini, the destroyer of evil and the protector of her devotees. A person can feel the true spirit of India, its culture, religion and history by being a part of the mesmerizing festivities of Durga Puja, which is one of the most significant festivals celebrated in Eastern India, especially in the state of West Bengal. The vivacious festival of Durga Puja resonates with the devotional fervor of the devotees of the Mother Goddess as it celebrates the Shakti (cosmic energy) in its various divine forms. Although it is indeed a significant Hindu religious festival, but it also marks a wonderful opportunity for people of various religions. Any festival in India is incomplete without food.<br><br>
                                                Whenever we talk of festival we think of the special dishes prepared for the occasion. Festival cooking is a part of all celebration. Durga Puja is also one of the festivals where special emphases on sweets are given.Dussehra is a festival of reverence of good and its power to subdue evil. This exhilarating and inspiring festival is celebrated by Hindus across India and is known by different names across the country. It is also known as Vijayadashmi, according to Hindu mythology. It is believed that it was on this day that Lord Rama killed Ravana, the demon King of Lanka to rescue his beloved wife Sita, after cutting ten heads of Ravana, on the tenth day of the ensuing battle. Hence, to celebrate the day, colossal effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhkarna and son Meghnath, filled with crackers and surrounded by fireworks, are burnt to signify the end of evil. Besides this, play enactments of Ramayana, known as Ram Leela are also preformed across India preceding Dussehra. These plays are based on the epic Ramayana, which describes the life saga of Lord Rama.</p>
