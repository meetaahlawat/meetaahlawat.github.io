            <p>Ever since I was a child, I have been behind the camera shooting pictures of friends and family. Or
                having pictures taken by a professional photographer and taking prints of them. These prints are items
                that I absolutely must have with me. They serve as a reminder of times gone by, times rapidly changing
                from print to digital. Once upon a time, parents documented their kids’ firsts and in words and pictures
                in baby books and scrapbooks that got updated as life’s big milestones got reached. Family photo albums
                grew thick with memories of trips, holidays, friends and relatives. But who has time for that now? Its
                true that print is the ultimate expression of photography.
