            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Meeta Ahlawat and i am from India. I have been a photographer for the last eight years of
                my life. I love travelling and meeting new people and telling unique stories through my photos.
                My passion for photography led me to diverse print publications and finally to United States of
                America. Charting out a new road for myself, i am now here at Academy of Art University, learning
                web design and new media. Change is the only thing constant and that's what drives me.

            <p>
                I love to read photo books, magazines, newspaper, buddhism books and fiction. I am an avid
                traveller and love the countryside. Whenever i get free time, i tidy things up and love to cook,
                trying out new cuisines. I love swimming and dancing. Gardening, reading, nature walks, photography
                are amongst few of my favourite things.
