                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>My first inspiration for photography came while I chanced upon books of Robert Capa and Henri Cartier
                    Bresson as a student of Mass Communication in Mumbai's Sophia University. It was a heady concoction of
                    spending hours pouring over their vivid pictures, while living in the midst of Mumbai's palpable madness
                    and chaos that compelled me to pick up a film camera and roam the streets. Through my lens I saw tons
                    and tons of people. I saw reality that was brutal and the pain and suffering which suffocated their
                    lives. With every shoot, a tiny portion of their life latched itself onto mine, allowing me to tell
                    their stories through my pictures.</p>
                <p>My passion for photography led me to diverse print publications: Down to Earth, Science and Environment
                    fortnightly, DIE ZEIT-Germany's largest weekly paper and The Hindu. As a News Photographer with The
                    Hindu, I strived to create a space for myself as a woman photojournalist in a man's world. </p>
                <p>My stint lasted with them for over two years and then I juggled life as a photographer with different
                    publications then on. I was always picked out to photograph my friend’s wedding ceremonies and that is
                    why I say I ‘juggled’ my life as a photojournalist. And realized that its time to transit into candid
                    wedding photography. There is a different feeling altogether photographing wedding moments. The emotions
                    and les sentiments people go though make it a sheer joy to be part of. I have a really good time at my
                    wedding assignments and make sure people I am shooting are at complete ease with my presence. Its like
                    as if I was almost born to make people smile with my photography. </p>
                <p>Currently I am based in San Jose, California but there is no road I am not willing
                    to travel in search of the union or a good story..</p>
