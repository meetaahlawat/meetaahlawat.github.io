                <p>Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given
                    the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines
                    vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits.
                    Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions.[1] There
                    has also been Middle Eastern and Central Asian influence on North Indian cuisine from the years of
                    Mughal rule.[2] Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural
                    interactions with other societies.</p>

                <p>talian cuisine (Italian: cucina italiana [kuˈtʃiːna itaˈljaːna]) has developed through centuries of
                    social and political changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.
                    Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes,
                    tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until
                    the 18th century.[1][2] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity,[3][4][5] abundance of
                    difference in taste, and it is probably the most popular in the world,[6][7] with influences
                    abroad.</p>

                <p>Chinese cuisine includes styles originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from
                    Chinese people in other parts of the world including most Asian nations. The history of Chinese
                    cuisine in China stretches back for thousands of years and has changed from period to period and in
                    each region according to climate, imperial fashions, and local preferences. Over time, techniques
                    and ingredients from the cuisines of other cultures were integrated into the cuisine of the Chinese
                    people due both to imperial expansion and from the trade with nearby regions in pre-modern times,
                    and from Europe and the New World in the modern period. Contrary to the beliefs of many, the usage
                    of dairy can be traced to ancient recipes as early as 9th century B.C. Animals such as buffalos are
                    important to agriculture and their dairy products are part of the Chinese diet and nomads also had
                    influence on Chinese diets. However, it was not legal to consume beef over part of the ancient
                    history. The belief that farming animals are sacred and beef is for the highest ritual has been
                    lasting and influential, as same clauses existed in ancient Japanese and Korean laws.</p>

                <p>Japanese cuisine has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, and encompasses the
                    regional and traditional foods of Japan. The traditional cuisine of Japan (和食 washoku?) is based on
                    rice with miso soup and other dishes, with an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often
                    consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Fish is common, often grilled,
                    but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light
                    batter as tempura.</p>

                <p>The cuisine of the United States reflects its history. The European colonization of the Americas
                    yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various
                    styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of
                    immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation
                    throughout the country.</p>
