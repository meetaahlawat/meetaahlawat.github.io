            <p>The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon,
                Paul
                McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most
                influential act of the rock era.[1] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the
                Beatles
                later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to
                psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the
                early
                1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", but as the group's music grew
                in
                sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an
                embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.</p>

            <p>Madonna Louise Ciccone (/tʃɪˈkoʊni/; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter,
                dancer,
                actress, and businesswoman. She achieved popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content
                in
                mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Madonna
                is
                known for reinventing both her music and image, and for maintaining her autonomy within the
                recording industry. Music critics have acclaimed her musical productions, which have generated
                some
                controversy. Referred to as the "Queen of Pop", Madonna is often cited as an influence by other
                artists.</p>
